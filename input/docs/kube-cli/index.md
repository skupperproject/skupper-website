# Overview of Skupper CLI on Kubernetes

You can use the `skupper` CLI on Kubernetes after installing the Skupper controller to configure sites, links and services. 

The Skupper CLI is designed to generate and consume standard resources, ensuring that a sites, links and services configured using the CLI are identical to those configured directly through YAML.

* [Create sites][site-configuration]
* [Link sites][site-linking] (requires that one site has link access enabled)
* [Expose and consume services][service-exposure]
