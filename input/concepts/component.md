# Component concept

A component is a logical part of an [application](application.html).
Each component has a set of responsibilities in achieving the goals
of the application.  Components provide and require _interfaces_
such as REST APIs or database listeners.  A component is implemented
by [workloads](workload.html).

An application has one or more components.  Each component provides
and requires zero or more interfaces.  Each component is implemented
by zero or more workloads.
