# Understanding TLS certificates for Kubernetes sites

Traffic between sites is encrypted using mutual TLS providing secure communication between Kubernetes clusters.
The traffic between Skupper components within a site is also encrypted using mutual TLS.
If you do not provide certificates, certificates are generated to create the mutual TLS connection and are stored in Kubernetes Secrets.
This section describes various traffic flows and how the certificates are generated and stored, allowing you to supply certificates for various scenarios as required.

**ðŸ“Œ NOTE**\
This section describes traffic between sites and traffic between Skupper components within a site. In addition, the [Understanding TLS traffic between applications and routers](#understanding-tls-traffic-between-applications-and-routers) section describes TLS traffic between a client and the router in a site, and then between the router and the server in a different site.

In TLS, two key checks occur during the handshake establishing the connection:

* **Trust of the peerâ€™s certificate**\
The certificate must be validated against a list of trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs).
If the certificate is signed by a trusted CA and the certificate chain is valid, the peerâ€™s certificate is trusted.
* **Server identity match**\
The hostname or IP address used by the client to connect to the server must match the Common Name (CN) or Subject Alternative Names (SANs) in the certificate supplied by the server.
If there is a mismatch, the connection is considered insecure.

Both conditions must be met for the connection to be established.

This section describes the Kubernetes Secrets involved for various scenarios so that you can populate those Secrets using custom certificates if required.

## Overview of TLS between sites and within a site

By default, Skupper creates Secrets to support TLS for the following traffic:

* **[Mutual TLS between sites](#mutual-tls-between-sites)**\
Traffic flowing between routers, including between routers in different sites.
Communication between routers is always encrypted, including routers in different sites.
* **[Mutual TLS within a site](#mutual-tls-within-a-site)**\
Traffic flowing between all Skupper components within a site, for example, between a router and the service controller.

When running in Kubernetes, Skupper expects specific Secrets that support TLS for each of the above scenarios in each namespace where it is installed.
These Secrets, which contain TLS keys and certificates for each of the scenarios above, are assigned predefined names.

When you create a site using the CLI or create a site declaratively using YAML, Skupper creates the required Secrets if they do not already exist.

If you use your certificates to populate the Secrets before the site is created, Skupper uses those certificates.

CA Secrets always have a name with the suffix `-ca`.
These are only used to generate certificates if the associated Secrets do not already exist.

**ðŸ’¡ TIP**\
See your provider documentation for generating certificates. For example, [Creating certificates for user workloads](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.17/security/cert_manager_operator/cert-manager-creating-certificate.html#cert-manager-certificate-mgmt_cert-manager-creating-certificate) if you use `cert-manager` on OpenShift.

## Mutual TLS between sites

When two sites are linked, the routers communicate using mutual TLS and the required keys and certificates are stored in specific Secrets:

* **`skupper-site-server`**\
Contains the key, certificate, and the CA certificate used by the `skupper-router` when accepting links from other sites.
* **`<link-specific-name>`**\
Contains the key, certificate, and the CA certificate used by the `skupper-router` when creating links to other sites.
The name of the Secret is the same as the link name.

To establish a link, both routers must verify the peerâ€™s certificate was signed by a trusted CA.

The router on the linking site must verify the certificate of the peer matches the hostname or IP address used to establish the link.

If these Secrets do not exist, Skupper generates and signs those certificates using a self-signed CA certificate created during site setup, which is then stored in the `skupper-site-ca` Secret.

**ðŸ“Œ NOTE**\
Skupper only uses the `skupper-site-ca` Secret if `skupper-site-server` is not populated.

## Mutual TLS within a site

The Skupper components within a site need to communicate. For example, the service controller needs to connect to the Skupper router.
This connection is secured using mutual TLS, and the required keys and certificates are stored in specific Secrets, all sharing the prefix **skupper-local-**:

* **`skupper-local-client`**\
Contains the key and certificate for the service controller, along with a list of trusted certificates used for verifying peer certificates.
* **`skupper-local-server`**\
Contains the key and certificate for the router, along with a list of trusted certificates used for verifying peer certificates.

If these Secrets do not exist, Skupper generates and signs those certificates using a self-signed CA certificate created during site setup, which is then stored in the `skupper-local-ca` Secret.

**ðŸ“Œ NOTE**\
Skupper only uses the `skupper-local-ca` Secret if `skupper-local-server` and `skupper-local-client` are not populated.

## Understanding TLS traffic between applications and routers

This section covers traffic between an application client and the router in a site, and then between the router and an application server in a different site.

**ðŸ“Œ NOTE**\
If you need information about TLS traffic between sites or traffic between Skupper components within a site, see [Understanding TLS certificates for Kubernetes sites](#understanding-tls-certificates-for-kubernetes-sites).

Consider the following scenarios:

**Application traffic between clients and routers, and between routers and servers**

![Three different network routing configurations between a client](../images/app-traffic.png)

* An HTTP application that receives requests from a client in a remote site.
The connection between the client and the router and the connection between the remote router and the server are unencrypted.
The communication between routers is always encrypted.
* An HTTPS application where the traffic is encrypted by the client and unencrypted by the remote server.
* An HTTPS application where traffic is encrypted at every stage: encrypted between the client and the router, re-encrypted between the routers, and re-encrypted between the router and the server at the remote site.

This section describes that third scenario, and the Secrets required to have TLS between the application and the router.

When a TLS connection from a client of a service is terminated and re-encrypted at the router, or when the router establishes a TLS connection to a pod implementing the service, additional Secrets are required.

By default, Skupper generates the following Secrets for this purpose, all sharing the prefix **skupper-service-**:

* **`skupper-service-client`**\
Contains credentials used for the TLS connection from the router to the pod implementing the service.
* **`skupper-service-ca`**\
Contains the trusted CA certificate used for validating client and server certificates in the TLS connection.

These Secrets can be provided by the user and specified through the `--tls-cert` and `--tls-trust` options to `skupper expose` or by using the equivalent annotations.

### Summary of TLS related Secrets
