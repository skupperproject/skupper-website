# Deployment options on Kubernetes

When you create a site on Kubernetes, there are many options you can use.  For example, you can set the number of pods and the resources allocated to each pod.
This guide focusses on the following goals:

* [Scaling for increased traffic](#scaling-for-increased-traffic)
* [Creating a high availability site](#creating-a-high-availability-site)
* [Service synchronization](#service-synchronization)

## Scaling for increased traffic

For optimal network latency and throughput, you can adjust the CPU allocation for the router using the `router-cpu` option.
Router CPU is the primary factor governing Skupper network performance.

**ðŸ“Œ NOTE**\
Increasing the number of routers does not improve network performance.  An incoming router-to-router link is associated with just one active router.  Additional routers do not receive traffic while that router is responding

1. Determine the router CPU allocation you require.

   By default, the router CPU allocation is `BestEffort` as described in [Pod Quality of Service Classes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-qos/#besteffort).

   Consider the following CPU allocation options:

| Router CPU | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Helps avoid issues with `BestEffort` on low resource clusters |
| 2 | Suitable for production environments |
| 5 | Maximum performance |
2. If you are using the Skupper CLI, set the CPU allocation for the router using the `--router-cpu` option.  For example:

   ```bash
   $ skupper init --router-cpu 2
   ```
3. If you are using YAML, set the CPU allocation for the router by setting a value for the `router-cpu` attribute.  For example:

   ```YAML
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: ConfigMap
   metadata:
     name: "skupper-site"
   data:
     name: "my-site"
     router-cpu: 2
   ```

## Creating a high availability site

By default, Kubernetes restarts any router that becomes unresponsive.
(If you encounter router restarts, consider [Scaling for increased traffic](#scaling-for-increased-traffic) in order to improve responsiveness.)

If the cluster where you are running Skupper is very busy, it may take time for Kubernetes to schedule a new router pod.  You can "preschedule" a backup router by deploying two routers in a site.

1. If you are using the Skupper CLI, set the number of routers to `2` using the `--routers` option:

   ```bash
   $ skupper init --routers 2
   ```
2. If you are using YAML, set the number of routers to `2` by setting the `routers` attribute:

   ```YAML
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: ConfigMap
   metadata:
     name: "skupper-site"
   data:
     name: "my-site"
     routers: 2
   ```

Setting the number of routers to more than two does not provide increased availability and can adversely affect performance.

Note: Clients must reconnect when a router restarts or traffic is redirected to a backup router.

## Service synchronization

By default, creating a site enables that site to synchronize all services from other default sites.
This means that all services exposed on the service network are available in the current site.
For example, if you expose the backend service in the `east` site, that service is automatically created in the `west` site.

However, if you want more granular control over which services are available, you can disable `service-sync`.
This might be required if:

* You expose many services and not all are required on all sites.
* You are concerned that a specific service is not available on a specific site.

To disable service synchronization:

```bash
$ skupper init --service-sync false
```

or use the following YAML:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: skupper-site
data:
  name: my-site
  service-sync: false
```

To check whether synchronization is enabled, check the value for `service-sync` in the output from the following command:

```bash
$ kubectl get cm skupper-site -o json
```

If you disable service-sync and you want to consume an exposed service on a specific site, you can create that service using the following command:

```bash
skupper service create <name> <port>
```

where `<name>` is the service name on the site where the service is exposed
and `<port>` is the port used to expose that service.

Notes:

* When considering whether services are synchronized between two sites, `service-sync` must be enabled on both sites.
* If you use the command `skupper service delete` on a site, that command only works if the service was created on that site.
* Podman sites do not support `service-sync`.
